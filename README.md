# E_shopping 
A shop wants to implement an E-Shopping Management System for its
platform of Selling and Buying Products. First, they wish to store
details of Customers like Customer_id,Name, contact and Address.
● The system stores details of Products in form of their categories like
cat_id, cat_name, Along with this, Product details (Product Name,
P_id) are also stored so that all Product details can be searched.
● Shopping Order (order_id and Date_of_order) maintains the details of
order being placed by a customer.
● Delivery table stores information like (Delivery_id and
Date_of_delivery) which helps to track the orders.
● Along with this a payment Table stores (Pay_id and Date_of Payment)
informing about the payment details and finally when the order is
placed and paid for, Transaction Details are generated having report_id
and other details from different tables as a foreign Key.
